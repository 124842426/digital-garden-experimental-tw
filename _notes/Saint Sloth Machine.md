### 簡介
聖・死啦什麼心的創作概念是基於姚大鈞的「泛具象音樂論」在通俗音樂的實踐，具體而言，其音樂創作不以聲音的物理性質如抽象音符和諧性或音色來決定，而是以人類聽覺習慣感知為標準，嘗試達到聲音和諧與聽覺快感，進而以其聲音樂音的具象性質作為抽象概念與抽象意境的傳達。

### About
Built on the idea of <Towards the Pan-Musique Concrète> by Dajuin Yao, the concept of St. Sloth Machine's music is to adapt the idea into pop music context. In short, their music is not based on the physical properties of Sound, e.g., the harmonies of notes or tones, nor of music, e.g., melody, harmony, rhythm or metre, which are often the Music symbols, or rather, the building blocks of a piece of music. St. Sloth Machine directly uses the common listening habits of human beings,  as the baseline to effectively stimulate the audiences, making Sound a concrete property to deliver abstract concepts and states of mind.
